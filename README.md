# Fire Alert System â€“ ESP32 Based

This repository contains the source code and documentation for an *ESP32-powered Fire Alert System* designed to detect potential fire hazards quickly and provide immediate warnings. The project integrates multiple sensors and alert mechanisms to enhance safety and can be extended for IoT-based remote notifications.

## Key Features

- *Multi-Sensor Monitoring:*  
  Utilizes a smoke sensor and a temperature sensor to detect early signs of fire or hazardous conditions.

- *Real-Time Alerts:*  
  Triggers an audible buzzer and visual indicators (LEDs) when thresholds are exceeded.

- *Modular Code Design:*  
  Easy to modify sensor thresholds, add new modules, or integrate with other systems.

- *Scalability:*  
  Can be expanded to include Wi-Fi-based alerts, SMS notifications, or cloud monitoring platforms.

## Hardware Requirements

- ESP32 microcontroller  
- Smoke sensor (MQ-2 or equivalent)  
- Temperature sensor (e.g., DHT11/DHT22)  
- Buzzer and LEDs  
- Breadboard, jumper wires, and power supply  

## Applications

- Residential fire detection  
- Industrial and warehouse safety monitoring  
- Laboratory or server room environmental control  

## Repository Contents

- Complete Arduino/ESP32 source code  
- Circuit diagrams for easy assembly  
- Setup instructions for quick prototyping and testing
